1. replication factor
2. search factor
3. secret key
splunk edit cluster-config -mode manager -replication_factor 4 -search_factor 3 -secret your_key -cluster_label cluster1
splunk restart

and then create indexes.conf in manager-apps



on peer:
splunk edit cluster-config -mode peer -manager_uri https://10.160.31.200:8089 -replication_port 9887 -secret your_key
splunk restart



splunk edit licenser-localpeer -manager_uri https://<lic_manager>:8089 - on every peer node
