next levels to upgrade the script:

new script for CM configuration:
on CM:
splunk add licenses <path to file>
and then get from the user, step by step: 
1. replication factor
2. search factor
3. secret key
splunk edit cluster-config -mode manager -replication_factor 4 -search_factor 3 -secret your_key -cluster_label cluster1
splunk restart

and then create indexes.conf in manager-apps



on peer:
splunk edit cluster-config -mode peer -manager_uri https://10.160.31.200:8089 -replication_port 9887 -secret your_key
splunk restart



splunk edit licenser-localpeer -manager_uri https://<lic_manager>:8089 - on every peer node



Dedicated script for indexer Clustering:
1. manager
2. peer nodes
3. SH

Task: 
Create a new branch with the complete file. 
Add a dedicated SH option at the start.
afterwards need to ask the user if it should be connected to indexer cluster and add the relevant CLI command
